1. Create a basic application composed of an on-chain smart contract that exhibits an <increment> function, that takes an integer (u32) as parameter, and increments a counter stored on chain by that amount.
It should also exhibit a function called <trigger_value> that takes no parameters and trigger the current value of this counter in an event.

2. Create a very basic front-end that displays the value stored in the counter of the SC.

You'll find relevant resources at https://docs.massa.net/.

### run the front end 
```bash
cd front/front && npm run dev
```
